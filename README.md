This repo is cloned and modified from [Learning to Speak from Text for Low-Resource TTS](https://github.com/Takaaki-Saeki/zm-text-tts) to use as a baseline for my other project [PRESENT](https://github.com/iamanigeeit/present).

Please refer to [inference.ipynb](egs2/masmultts/tts1/inference.ipynb) if you want to run inference with the Takaaki-Saeki's pretrained multilingual model. I did it for Mandarin and provide the pinyin to IPA conversion in []
